      "This project takes advantage of a texting service to track attendance at events. A user texts a chosen keyword to the organization's telephone number, and is linked with the event that uses the same keyword. Their data is then dynamically captured and stored in a database, and becomes searchable in the app. The organizers can then review individuals' data and text them within the app to inform about future events, etc. Currently this app uses Clearstream for the texting aspects, but could easily be converted to a company like Twilio, Trumpia, or similar companies. This app was built using the MERN stack."

Each question is allotted 15secondsâ€” with correct answers adding time to the clock, and incorrect answers subtracting time. The user's time remaining at the end of the questions is their final score."
